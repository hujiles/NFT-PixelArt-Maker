### NFT-PixelArt-Maker

A simple pixel art generator. The purpose for me to do this is to popularize the production of series such as cryptopunks.You can improve the codes


- Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install Python and add path
- Install all requirements
- If you dont have pip get pip first
[get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
CTRL+S(same folder)
- python3 get-pip.py
- pip install pillow
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python main.py

## WARNING!

You can add new ones to the files in the directory and generate more.
But the important thing is that the pixels are adjusted according to these size.
- body = 336 x 336
- glasses = 190 x 109
- beard = 58 x 54
- head = 145 x 131
If you want to make a new series, you must change the codes.
